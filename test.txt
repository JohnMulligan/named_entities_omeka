Still ochers worked as masons on the for-\ntifications. The most humble probably gained their livelihoods as simple\nwage earners in construction, in the slaughterhouses, or as stevedores.\nAnd of course over a thousand soldiers and hundreds of common sailors\nrounded out the lower stratum of white society. Finally, small farmers\nsurrounded the city, and in the outer hinterland, penetrated the creases\nbetween the large Jandholdings.34\n\n’ An intriguing component of urban Havana was the free black and mu-\nlatto population. Numbering some 8,107 in 1778, this element was viewed\nas inferior by birthright, politically unreliable, and socially degenerate. In\neffect it constituted a separate legal estate subject to severe personal con-\nstraints and harsh judicial standards. Captain General Navarro, for ex-\nample, decreed in 1779 that\n\nexperience has shown just and reasonable the motives by which the Laws of\nthe Indies and the Municipal Ordinances of this island prohibited that free\nNegroes and mulattoes [/oros} or slaves might bear any type of arms openly\nor concealed by day or night. . . . Therefore, in compliance with the aforemen-\ntioned royal dispositions, I order and command that no free mulatto, Negro,\nor zambaygo or slave may bear or carry arms openly or concealed by day or\nnight, except the officers of the Battalions of Pardos and Morenos when they\nappear dressed in their respective uniforms, and the rest of the volunteers when\nthey are performing militia functions, and under no other circumstance subject\nto the penalty of fifty lashes for slaves and a sentence of three months at royal\nlabor for freedmen . . . with the declaration that if any Negro or mulatto takes\nup arms against a white person, even if he does not use them, he shall be given\none hundred lashes and have his hand nailed down [clavarse la mano} on the\nfirst occasion {and} cut off on the second, unless he can prove that he acted\nin self defense.?¢\n\nSurely most performed menial tasks as stevedores, salaried construc-\ntion workers, household servants, and day laborers. Others were vagrants,\nscraping together their livings by whatever means possible. Yet some,\nperhaps a significant number, had become artisans and craftsmen.?” The\n1765 service records for the battalions of black and mulatto militia, for\nexample, showed a wide variety of occupations mainly related to construc-\ntion and tailoring. Out of a total of seventy-nine officers and sergeants there\nwere thirty-seven carpenters, sixteen tailors, five masons, five cobblers, four\nsilversmiths, two sculptors, two belt makers, two ironsmiths, one musi-\ncian, one scribe, one stonecutter, one painter, and two laborers.3? Some\nwere moderately wealthy.

It should\nbe remembered, however, that militia officers represented the elite of their\nestate and constituted only a small portion of the total free black and mu-\nlatto population. Another 3,087 free blacks and mulattoes lived in the\nhinterland where although most worked as day laborers, at least some ap-\npear to have operated their own farms.*° Finally, some 11,418 slaves toiled v\nin Havana, as.did another 14,478 in the surrounding area.‘\n\nThe British conquest of Hayana in August.1762 opened a period in the\nhistory of the city and its hinterland that witnessed military expenditures\nbecome the dominant force in the economy but which concurrently saw\nan acceleration of those changes already underway in the agricultural and_5\ncommerical sectors. Despite its importance to Havana, the sum spent on\nthe military during the decades immediately preceding the Seven Years’ War\nwas comparatively unimpressive due to the strategies pursued by the ad-\nministration of Ferdinand VI (1746-59). Following the Treaty of Aix-la-\nChapelle of 1748, Ferdinand’s government cultivated a neutral foreign policy\nin the midst of the continuing international rivalry between the United\nKingdom and France. This orientation permitted the crown to curtail co-\nlonial expenditures while maximizing the remission of American revenues\nto Madrid. A separate but related factor was the survival of the early Bour-\nbon strategy for land defense. This strategy envisioned the protection of\nkey military strongholds by means of fixed fortifications manned by small\nveteran garrisons which would be reinforced by European-based battalions\nduring periods of crisis. Tactics were designed to force the enemy into\nlengthy sieges and depended essentially on climate and disease, not fire-\npower, for victory. This strategy worked at Cartagena in 1741, appeared\ncost efficient, and thus continued in force.*? Rebuilding the fleet was a top\npriority, as confirmed by the naming of Baylio Frey Juli4n de Arriaga, a\nman with strong ties to the maritime establishment and the former presi-\ndent of the Casa de Contratacién, as minister of the Indies and of the navy\nin 1754.\n\nSerious deficiencies had emerged in Havana’s ring of defenses by the\neve of Spain’s intervention in the Seven Years’ War. Despite its ambitious\nnaval construction Spain, as usual, had to concede supremacy to the Brit-\nish. This meant that the enemy could choose his point of attack. In their\nill-fated siege of Cartagena the British had shown the ability to hurl a\nmassive invasion force at the Spanish empire, but while British military\npower in America grew during the intervening period, Spain did not ad-\njust. The Havana garrison, although large by American standards, was\ndestined to be badly outnumbered. Moreover, problems had emerged in\nthe fortifications.

These\nsums, however, included the funds used to purchase tobacco for the royal Factory—\nmoney not therefore entered into the Havana treasury—and sometimes funds relayed\nto other Gulf and Caribbean outposts. TePaske’s figures show a sharp drop-off in 1786,\n1787, and probably 1788.

Why much’smaller\namounts were actually registered in the colonial treasury is a mystery since most of the\nother outposts had separate monies specifically allocated to them in the records for these\nyears and tobacco costs normally ran about a half million annually at chis time. In\nany event, it should be remembered that, following the death of José de Galvez in 1787,\ncolonial policy shifted toward cutting colonial expenditures and maximizing remissions\nto Madrid. .\n\n54.

Kuethe\n\nlocal taxes, but with unfortunate results.4? By 1762 the wall stood in a\nstate of grievous disrepair as announced by the disturbing appearance of\nseveral large fissures.** More serious still, the Cabana Heights overlooking\nthe Morro Castle remained undefended despite local concern over the\npotential danger to Havana’s security. On the eve of Spain’s intervention\nin the Seven Years’ War the crown ordered the hill fortified, but the provi-\nsion for that enormous undertaking came too late and was too little.*5\n\nWhen the new monarch, Charles III (1759-88), found himself unable\nto maintain neutrality in the struggle that raged between France and the\nUnited Kingdom, he led to war an empire that was ill suited to counter\nthe well-oiled British war machine fresh from sensational victories in Can-\nada and the French Antilles. Spain, as planned, managed to reinforce\nHavana with two battalions of European regulars before the British inva-\nsion, but they were not enough, especially after disease had taken its usual\ntoll and the fortification system failed.46 The loss of Havana, the antemural\nof imperial defense, shook Madrid to its very foundation. As is well known,\nthis defeat opened the way for a profound rethinking of imperial strategy\nand policy. To match British power would require both a massive military\nbuildup and a far-reaching colonial reorganization to create the financial\nand administrative apparatus to sustain that commitment. Retrieved from\nthe British in exchange for Florida under the Treaty of Paris, Havana was\nthe initial focus of these reformist initiatives.\n\nThe defeat immediately revealed the inadequacies of the fortifications\nof the city and bay as well as the danger of relying too heavily on fixed\nemplacements at the expense of the regular army. Consequently the finan-\ncially momentous decision was made to fortify the Cabana Heights, which\nhad easily fallen into British hands and from which the invaders had suc-\ncessfully laid siege to the Morro. The decision was also made to construct\nfortifications on the western flank of the city where the British had landed\nforces and managed to divert Havana’s exposed water supply into the bay.\nMoreover the Morro Castle and Havana’s battered walls had to be repaired.\nInitial estimates placed the cost of these works at roughly half a million\npesos annually.*7\n\nThe veteran garrison was expanded to 2,675 men at an annual cost of\nroughly 400,000 pesos. To generate additional trained manpower Charles\nIll resolved to incorporate effectively the native population into the burden\nof defense. This step was implemented through the establishment of a\ndisciplined militia, which included white regiments of cavalry and infan<\ntry and one battalion each of black (moreno) and mulatto (pardo) infan-\ntry. Provided with a standardized table of organization, these units were\narmed and uniformed, drilled weekly by veteran officers and enlisted men\nintegrated into the chain of command, and granted full military privileges.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 23\n\nThe wages of the veteran advisors and a limited number of volunteers main-\ntained on permanent salary added some 60,000 pesos to the sum of royal\nexpenditures in Havana.*®\n\nThe crown also resolved to sustain its ship-building program. Eighteen\nwarships lost in the battle had to be replaced and others built. Between\n1765 and.1797 seventy ships of the line, frigates, brigs, schooners, and\nxabecks were constructed in Havana for the fleet, including the 130-gun\nSantisima Trinidad in 1769. The naval treasury, which also funded costs\nlike the careening of ships and personnel salaries, expended roughly 700,000\npesos annually through the period between the Seven Years’ War and the\nWar of the American Revolution, affording yet another major source of\nincome for Havana during the postwar period.*?\n\nFundamental to this feverish military buildup was a revolution in mili-\ntary thinking. Havana was perceived not only as a defensive stronghold\nbut as the base for offensive warfare. Spain emerged from the Seven Years’\nWar defeated but not humbled. In conjunction with France, his ally under\nthe Third Family Compact, Charles II plotted revenge against the hated\nBritish, and both powers sought to reopen the hostilities at the first oppor-\ntunity. Diplomatic complications and French internal difficulties delayed\nthis objective, but the War of the American Revolution provided a golden\nopportunity to settle old scores.\n\nIn a position to menace British holdings in Jamaica as well as in the\neastern Mississippi Valley and Florida, Havana acted as the base for offen-\nsive action when Spain entered the war in 1779. The fleet anchored in its\nharbor and—much to the chagrin of Madrid—seldom left, casting thou-\nsands of sailors and marines onto the Havana consumer market. The\ncrown also placed the Havana garrison on a wartime footing, introducing\nan additional Spanish regiment of 1,358 men in 1776 and another regiment\nin 1779. The number of troops on hand during the war is difficult to cal-\nculate because many were sent on to the offensive in Louisiana and Florida,\nbut Havana supplied them whether at home or on the North American\ncontinent. Moreover in 1780 Spain deployed the Army of Operations in\nHavana, a force that departed from Cadiz at the strength of 7,737 along\nwith another full regiment for the Havana garrison. Not all of these men\nreached Cuba at the same time, however, and some never arrived at all.\nAfflicted by a severe epidemic during the crossing, many were unloaded\nin the French and Spanish islands to the east and only gradually drifted\nback to the main force while others died or deserted. Once in Havana,\na portion of this force was sent north to participate in Bernardo de Galvez’s\noffensive against Pensacola and, later, in Guarico as part of an abortive\nOperation against Jamaica. Nevertheless these troop movements entailed\nan influx into Havana of thousands of men at one time or another.

Kuethe\n\nhad occurred and where military demands were the greatest, would be the\ntesting ground with the needs of the colonial capital played against the\npower of entrenched vested interests in Spain. Peninsular shareholders of\nthe Royal Havana Company hoped to see their privileges upheld, a hopeless\nproposition from the start, But the Consulado of Cadiz, which viewed any\nliberalization of policy as a threat to its larger privileged position, possessed\npowerful political connections and posed a serious obstacle to reform. Dur-\ning 1763~65, therefore, Ricla negotiated with the Havana patriciate while\nEsquilache used the habanero demands as leverage in the intense political\ninfighting at court. Havana made its case effectively, showing a willingness\nto accept tougher taxation but at the same time advancing a ten-point pro-\nposal that envisioned a radical liberalization of trade policy.**\n\nThe outcome, as institutionalized by two royal decrees of October 1765,\n\nVaid indeed raise Cuban taxes but in return granted sweeping commercial\nconcessions. Although the Cuban alcabala was tripled, increasing from\n2. to 6 percent, and new taxes were placed on colonial liquors, liberaliza-\ntion of the trade laws responded to habanero demands. The October de-\ncrees opened the commerce of Havana to eight additional Spanish ports,\nlegalized the use of Cuban ships in the European trade, rationalized the\nlevies and procedures imposed on Spanish shipping to Havana, and\nbenefited Cubans in consolidating the taxes on sugar production and sales\nin the-6 percent alcabala. Moreover Cubans were free to conduct unre-\nstricted commerce in colonial goods with Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico,\nTrinidad, and Margarita, all of which received the same privileges as\nHavana. The Esquilache government had hoped eventually to extend a\nsimilar system throughout much of the empire, but riots in Madrid and\nthe provinces five months after the October decrees forced the king to dis-\nmiss and exile his chief minister. The momentum for reform would not\nbe recaptured until one of Esquilache’s creatures, José de Galvez, became\nminister of the Indies in January 1776 following the death of Julian de Ar-\nriaga. Using Cuba’s commercial successes as justification and operating\nduring a period of intense international crisis, Galvez extended the Cuban\nmodel to the rest of the empire in 1778, except for New Spain and Caracas\nwhich, owing to special considerations, were not brought fully into the\nsystem until 1789.5?\n\nAn additional dimension of Spanish military preparations that helped\nredefine the position of Havana was the establishment of the royal monthly\nmail service. Until this time the Consulado had transported the mail through\nits commercial shipping, but service proved slow and irregular. In 1764 the\ncrown instituted a new system under which La Corufia served as the Span-\n\n‘ish terminus; Havana, the American. The monthly ships served to tighten\n\n//Havana’s communication with Spain and, among other things, facilitated\n\n \n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 27\n\nthe conduct of overseas business. The system also opened yet another ave-\nnue for commerce because these vessels were permitted to carry cargo both\ncoming and going.®°\n\nThe effects of the new commercial policy quickly became apparent.\nAlthough Cadiz sustained its dominance in the Havana trade, a host of\nships from the other ports, most of them small carriers, entered the Cuban\nmarketplace while Cubans themselves reached out to conduct commerce.\nLarge Cadiz-based vessels, which due to their size required careful plan-\nning and lengthy stays in port, retained an important role, but brigantines,\nsloops, and saetias, which roved the Caribbean and the ports of Spain,\nboth expanded the volume of shipping and introduced.marketing flexi-\nbility. And the monthly mail ships abetted this development. The Regula-\ntion of Free Trade of 1778, moreover, qualified four additional Spanish\nports, broadened the legal channels for intercolonial trade and, by stimu-\nlating overall commerce, increased enormously the number of ships pass-\ning through the port of Havana. The city thus not only retained but ex-\npanded its historic function as a way station and entrepdt, and under the\nnew flexible arrangements it became additionally possible to localize en- “\ntrepreneurial decision making.\n\nThe dramatic transformation of Havana’s hinterland that accompanied\nthis liberalization of commercial policy is a familiar story. With millions\nupon millions of Mexican pesos pouring into their capital-rich economy,\nand with a surer marketing mechanism now available, babaneros quickly “\nexpanded their commitment to sugar. Between 1760 and 1791 Cuban out-\nput tripled, standing at 1,246,000 arrobas in 1790, and the island jumped\nfrom eleventh to fourth place in the world production.® In that the sugar\nrevolution was only gradually reaching the outer districts, much of this\ngrowth was registered in Havana's hinterland. Equally telling was the city’s\nrole in the Spanish marketplace. During the 1780s and early 1790s direct\nshipping from Havana:accounted for an impressive percentage of Spain’s\ntotal American trade, ranging from 13.5 percent in 1786 to nearly 24 per-\ncent in 1790 to just under 25 percent in 1795, but peaking at slightly over\n34 percent in 1793. Moreover, hundreds of other ships that began their\nvoyages in the Gulf or the Caribbean—mainly in Veracruz and Cartagena—\nmade stopovers in Havana and took on additional cargo before continuing\non to Spain.** Sometime in the middle 1780s sugar probably superseded v\ndefense spending as Havana’s most important industry.\n\nThroughout this process, the political dimension retained its dynamics.\nHabaneros learned from their 1765 triumph over Cadiz that the.royal ad-\nministration could be manipulated to their advantage.

Habaneros, like their Spanish cousins, viewed bread as\nan indispensable part of their daily diet, but Cuba produced no wheat.\nMexico supplied part of Havana’s needs, and Spain aspired to provide the\nrest. Indeed the curious phenomenon developed whereby United States flour\nreached Cuba via the mail ships of La Corufia, a circuitous and expensive\nroute to say the least.76 A direct traffic was of course much preferred both\nin Cuba and in the United States. Neutral trade therefore provided not only\na coveted outlet for sugar but ensured for Havana a reliable supply of its\nmost basic staple. .\n\nThe social consequences of Havana’s economic transformation were\ndramatic. The 1792 census recorded 51,307 inhabitants for Havana and\n65,857 for its rapidly developing hinterland as compared to 40,737 and\n41,000 respectively just fourteen years earlier. Reflecting the liberalization\nof the slave trade, the slave population had jumped to 17,970 in Havana\nand 23,530 in the hinterland whereas it had stood at 11,418 and 14,478 in\n1778. The free black and mulatto population of Havana accounted for\nanother 9,800 and in the hinterland 6,818, meaning that the combined slave\nand free black and mulatto population had nearly come to equal that of\nwhites. Indeed, for the island as a whole, the white population found itself\n\nV in the minority for the first time, numbering 133,559 out of a total of\n272,301.77 ;\nThe luster of the planter aristocracy also reflected the expansion of the\n¥ V sugar industry. Families such as the Beitias, Beltrans, Calvos, Chacéns,\nNiifiezes, Montalvos, and O’Farrills gained sway over huge estates. Whereas\nonly five men held titles of Castile in 1762, twenty did so by 1790.78 Not\nall of the elite acquired titles, of course. The sons of Juan OFarrill, who\nranked at the very top of habanero society, contented themselves with high\noffices in the military although most of their sisters married noblemen.\nTo the planter mentality the quest for military honors was commonplace\nand, during the 1790s, habaneros fattened the royal purse by outright pur-\nchase, usually of supernumerary captaincies or colonelcies either in the\nregular army or the militia. By 1799 Cubans held a majority of the offices\nin the veteran garrison, including half the proprietary colonelcies.”? And\nthis same element continued to dominate the municipal government and\nother local offices.8° The elite congregated in the central, bayside section\nof Havana, particularly along the Plaza Nueva, the Plaza de San Francisco,\nand the Calles de los Oficiales, Cuba, Obrapia, Baratillo, Sol, Acosta,\nRicla, los Mercaderes, and de la Inquisicién, boasting palatial mansions\nthat attested to their social preeminence.*! ;\nA striking characteristic of the Havana elite was its cosmopolitan char-\nacter, not a surprising feature given the city’s location on the trade routes\n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 31\n\nand its proximity to the United States. Many families sustained ties with\ntheir Spanish cousins or held property in Iberia.*2 As early as midcentury,\nhabaneras showed a distinct fondness for the latest Madrid fashions.®3 Tra-\nvel to court to attend to personal business, seek medical care, or solicit\nmilitary honors was not uncommon. And some of the elite placed their\nchildren in honored positions. The Marqués del Real Socorro and the\nConde de Casa Montalvo, for example, each had two sons accepted by\nthe very select Royal College of Nobles. Among Spanish Americans the\nachievement of Gonzalo O’Farrill, son of Juan, was unique. He reached\nthe rank of lieutenant general of the army and eventually became minister\nof war. Joaquin Beltran de Santa Cruz y Cardenas resided at court for\nseven years in order to attend to his far-flung business interests and to soli-\ncit personal and military honors. By 1797, when he finally returned to\nHavana, he had become the Conde de Santa Cruz de Mopos, a brigadier\nin the regular army, and subinspector general of the army of Cuba—a\nposition no creole had ever held—and he had won the right to import a\nwhopping 100,000 barrels of flour into the island. His wife, Maria Teresa\nMontalvo y O'Farrill, daughter of the Conde de Casa Montalvo and grand-\ndaughter of Juan O’Farrill, remained at court to attend to family interests.\nShe became recognized as one of Madrid’s finest hostesses and was well\nknown to the Spanish cabinet and in artistic and literary circles.84 Fran-\ncisco Arango y Parrefio resided at court during the early 1790s as Havana’s\nlobbyist. Later, in the company of the Conde de Casa Montalvo who was\nin Madrid on the occasion of the establishment of the Havana Patriotic\nSociety, he toured Portugal, England, Jamaica, and Barbados to secure the\nlatest information on sugar production and processing.®5 Others developed\nclose connections with Havana’s neighbor to the north as a quickening\ncommerce strengthened personal and cultural ties.\n\nThe connection of the planter aristocracy to the merchant class is an\nintriguing but still unresolved dimension of late eighteenth-century Havana.\nIn the early years, when the elite held mixed investment portfolios, a num-\nber of investors in tobacco, cattle, and sugar also took a direct hand in\nmarketing, constituting what Levi Marrero termed a “protobourgeoisie.”®\nAnd, as already mentioned, the Conde de Mopos was deeply involved in\nthe flour trade as late as the turn of the century. Yet descriptions of the\nelite rarely mention merchant activity during the later period, suggesting\na pattern of occupational transformation as monoculture set in toward\ngreater, perhaps exclusive, landed investment. Certainly the planter patri-\nciate sustained an active role in the marketing of its products as shown\nby its role in the Consulado and by other lobbying activities, but the actual\nconduct of commercial transactions appears to have become the province\n\n \n\n \n\u000c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n32 Allan J. Kuethe\n\nof a resident merchant class with close ties to the United States. It is in-\nstructive that the Consulado was constituted in a manner that would en-\nsure planter dominance over its merchant constituency.®”\n\nMilitia service elevated status for the free black and mulatto artisans\nand laborers who enlisted by exempting them from various local levies and\nby affording them access to the fuero militar—that is, to the right to pre-\nsent their legal causes before military rather than ordinary justice. Military\n\ny Vprivileges and the honor of the uniform afforded a coveted measure of\nprestige. In an arrangement similar to those discussed previously, for ex-\nample, Gabriel Barba raised and uniformed a company of hussars for the\nmoreno battalion during the First British War. In return for his services,\nhe became captain. On another level, the officers of the pardo battalion\nshowed their loyalty and appreciation by the humble but surely generous\ncontribution of 996 pesos to the king’s war chest.®8\n\nBlacks and mulattoes were not granted full command of their units,\nhowever, as each battalion had attached to it a separate white command\nand staff group which exercised effective authority, an imposition that was\nobviously unwelcome.®? In 1789 and again in 1812 black officers petitioned\nfor the right to organize battalions to be commanded solely by their own\nrank.°° Havana contrasted with at least some coastal cities, such as Car-\ntagena and Guayaquil, where men of obscure origin managed to redefine\ntheir status through militia office, often by agreeing to provide uniforms\nfor companies in the white units. And in those same colonies Spanish\nofficers, acting in the interest of corporate integrity and contemptuous of\nthe pretenses of creole magistrates, occasionally sheltered black soldiers\nagainst ordinary justice.*! In Havana no such flexibility appeared, for in\ncontrast to coastal New Granada, the city’s social structure was quite rig-\n\n« idly defined by the time of the military reform and became more so with\nthe advance of the sugar revolution. Spanish officers, closely tied to the\nHavana patriciate through the arrangements established following the Seven\nYears’ War and sustaiiied in the succeeding generation, dared not tamper\nwith existing norms. And petitions for new battalions under the command\nof black officers was met with contempt and not a little apprehension.??\nBlacks and mulattoes, then, might enter crafts and trades, become moder-\nately wealthy, and even become militia officers, all of which granted them\na measure of prestige within their own sphere. But they remained firmly\n\n* locked into an inferior estate with little, if any, hope of escape.\n\nFranklin Knight has documented a slippage in the status of slaves-as\nthe sugar revolution advanced during the nineteenth century, and there is\nevery reason to believe that this process was already underway in the late\neighteenth century.®? The events in Saint Domingue sent tremors across\n\n \n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 33\n\nthe island, and the emergence of a black and mulatto majority in the 1792\ncensus accentuated those fears. The Consulado, for example, citing the\nsocial danger posed by the black population, petitioned for the abolition\nof the pardo and moreno battalions in 1799, and the habanero Francisco\nMontalvo, who had become subinspector general of the army, renewed the\nplea in 1812 during the panic created by the Aponte Conspiracy. The crown,\nmindful of Cuba’s exposed military position during those troubled years,\nwould have none of it, but these petitions attest to the socially repressive\nsetting in which all blacks, slave.or free, had come to find themselves.*4\n\nLand usage was a final issue. The growth of sugar plantings occurred\nat the expense of cattle ranches, small.tobacco farms, and ultimately the\nprotected forests; with this growth arose the demand for a modernization\nof the land tenure system itself. Cattle ranches gave way most easily as they\nshowed a low profit margin and stood relatively unprotected by law. It is\ninstructive that as early as the 1780s Havana was importing salted meat\nfrom Buenos Aires to feed the slaves.95 Tobacco, a royal monopoly, and\nthe forests, tied to Spain’s ship-building aspirations, were another matter.\nBoth the Royal Factory, which sought to guarantee adequate tobacco sup-\nplies for the Spanish market, and the newly established Commandancy\nGeneral of Marine, which held jurisdiction over the cutting of timber, stood\nas obstacles to the emerging monoculture. Consequently as early as the\n1790s the Consulado, led by its syndic, Francisco Arango y Parrefio, en-\ngaged the royal administration in a campaign to eliminate obstacles to a\nfree market use of landed property. This struggle also entailed the desire\nto convert from older property arrangements whereby mercedes or land\ngrants entailed certain responsibilities to the crown or the general welfare.\nThe regime of Charles IV held fast, however, much to the chagrin of the\nplanter patriciate which not only wanted new space for plantings but cov-\neted the trees for consumption in their mills and for packing material.\nHavana continued to import lumber, much now coming from the United\nStates.\n\nWhile Charles [V could withstand these pressures, his son could not.\nLooking ahead, Ferdinand VII (1808-33), embattled by an empire beset\nwith insurgency and seeking to promote stability in his American strong-\npoint, acceded to every habanero demand. In 1814 he removed the encum-\nbrances on land usage. In 1815 he forsook the forests, granting unrestricted\ncutting rights. In 1817 he abolished the tobacco monopoly, abdicating\nresponsibility for protecting the tobacco lands. And in 1818 he granted\nCuba the right to free trade in the world market.9” These were the final\nsteps in transforming Havana’s hinterland from a mixed economy to one\noverwhelmingly dependent on sugar and destined for entrapment in mono-\n\n \n\u000c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI\n{!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n16 Allan J. Kuethe\n\nonists held half the shares and thus enjoyed a strong voice in corporate\naffairs. The effect of this arrangement was to transfer to Havana an impor-\ntant level of entrepreneurial decision making.\n\nDuring the next two decades the Havana Company, as anticipated,\nbroadened the legal outlets for Cuban produce, but it was not destined\nto enjoy long-term success.. Its major difficulties arose from the obligation\nimposed by Madrid to build warships for the royal navy and to furnish\nthe Royal Factory in Seville with tobacco although at prices that tended\nto run too close to costs. The ship-building responsibility resulted in ma-\njor financial losses, and the company failed to provide quality tobacco leaf\nin sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the Royal Factory. Unable to\nfulfill its obligations, the Royal Company saw its privileges gradually with-\ndrawn. Despite its difficulties, however, the company had improved Ha-\nvana’s legal commercial outlets, presiding over an economic quickening in\nthe Havana district and, as such, served as a stepping stone toward the\ndramatic transformation that would occur during the remainder of the eigh-\nteenth century.?\n\nAs suggested above, Havana’s hinterland experienced important changes\nduring the decades immediately preceding the Seven Years’ War. Blessed\nby a favorable climate and exceptionally fertile soil, the city was surrounded\nby small farms that served not only to supply foodstuffs for the maritime\ntraffic but to produce a high-quality tobacco which, as already seen, en-\njoyed strong demand in Spain. Farther out, tobacco farms coexisted with\nlarge ranches that furnished beef for the local market and hides for ex-\nport!° Neither tobacco nor cattle, however, held much promise as growth\nproducts. Tobacco had been made a royal monopoly in 1717 with fixed\nprices and constricted sales? Smuggling naturally offered an important al-\nternative but was probably less significant in the heavily governed Havana\ndistrict than in the more remote portions of the island. The fundamental\nproblem besetting the cattle industry was the traditional policy of permit-\nting the municipalities to fix meat prices at a level agreeable to the urban\nconsumer, a practice resulting in low profitability!2 On the other hand,\nhides could be exported, often as packing material, and some ‘beef was\nsold to the passing maritime traffic. Hide exports showed modest growth\nduring the decades preceding the Seven Years’ War, but the concurrent up-\nsurge of competition from Buenos Aires depressed world prices, adding\nto the ranchers’ economic distress!3\n\nThe alternative was sugar. Revisionist historians Levi Marrero and John\nMcNeill have attacked the proposition that the first major upward steps\nof the sugar industry occurred either after the English occupation of Ha-\nvana in 1762-63 or after the destruction of the slave society of Saint Dom-\ningue in 1791. They have documented the rise of the Cuban sugar industry\n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 17\n\nduring the decades immediately preceding the Seven Years’ War when wary\ntobacco raisers and frustrated cattle ranchers transferred their investments\nto cane.4 Sugar’s gain was encouraged by royal policy which permitted\nCuban sugar tax-free access to the Cadiz market under the charter of the\nRoyal Havana Company and which concurrently extended that same ex-\nemption to hides. Moreover, at least during the early years of the Royal\nHavana Company, the crown also sought to limit tobacco production to\nequal the quantity needed for the Seville factory. Ostensibly designed to\ncurtail smuggling, this measure had the effect of shifting investment and\nslave labor to sugar production!5 Negotiated with habaneros, the tax ex-\nemptions suggest that the Cuban patriciate grasped the potential for agri-\ncultural diversification by at least 1740. High prices during the 1750s quick-\nened this reorientation and, on the eve of the Seven Years’ War, sugar had\ncome to rival, or perhaps surpass, tobacco in the export trade!$ Patricians\nstill held substantial investments in cattle ranching but had definitely moved\naway from tobacco which more and more had become the small producer’s\nuncertain haven. Havana and its hinterland -thus sustained a diversified\neconomy based on agricultural production and maritime services.\nHavana’s shipyards, the most important in the Spanish empire, added\nyet another dimension to the diversified economy. Between 1714 and 1762,\na period when the early Bourbons labored desperately to reestablish Span:\nish naval power, the Havana shipyard produced sixty-six warships for His\nMajesty’s fleet, most of them ships of the line or frigates, accounting for\nroughly two-fifths of all Spanish maritime construction?” Ship building\n\nw\n\n|¥\n\nv\n\naffected both urban Havana and the hinterland. For Havana this industry ,\n\nranked as yet another major economic activity. For the hinterland it repre-\nsented a mixed blessing. The high demand for timber, a commodity read-\nily available in the magnificent forests that stood mainly to the east and\nsoutheast of Havana, led to the accumulation of at least several fortunes\nand provided employment for woodcutters and those who transported the\nlogs to the shipyards.\n\nThe lumber business, for example, was a prominent component in the\nfinancial and ultimately the social success of the Justiz family, which ex-\nploited its vast holdings in the Matanzas region to meet the demand in\nthe royal shipyard. Although holding mixed investment portfolios, which\nincluded sugar and tobacco, Manuel José de Aparicio del Manzano y\nJustiz, the Marqués de Justiz de Santa Ana, and his half-brother, Jerénimo\nde Contreras y Juistiz, who would become the Conde de Gibacoa in 1764,\nmade a substantial portion of their early fortunes in the lumber business!#\nWhile others presumably profited in a similar fashion, all did not set well\nwith the Havana patriciate.

But in the early nineteenth century these dangers did not register\nand, given the comparative profitability of sugar, opportunity seemed\nunlimited.\n\nEighteenth-century Havana, then, enjoyed an enviable existence. Located\non the major trade routes and the antemural of a military-ininded govern-\nment, it profited from lucrative commercial outlets, provided a wide range\nof services and— particularly during the decades following the Seven Year’s\nWar—benefitted from massive royal spending both to bolster its security\nand to advance imperial military objectives. A powerful, astute, and en-\ntrepreneurially oriented patriciate, adept at manipulating the imperial\npolitical system, exploited these advantages to propel Cuba into the sugar\nrevolution of the-late century, a revolution destined to recast the social\nstructure, the hinterland, and urban Havana in the profoundest way as\nthe traditionally diversified economy gave way to monoculture. Exploiting\nits geographic advantages and productive hinterland, babaneros turned their\ncity into a major marketing center both for the island’s own commerce\nand for that of the Spanish American continent. To this degree the Carib-\nbean entrepét much resembled Philadelphia and New York as described\nby Jacob Price. Havana was an enormous city for such a small island, but\nits-size was commensurate to the unique place it occupied in the larger\nifmperial system and, ultimately, to the role that its sugar was destined to\nplay in the world economy and, above all, in the nearby markets of the\nUnited States.\n\n \n \n\nNOTES\n\n1. Havana’s hinterland is here understood to encompass those areas juridically sub-\nject to the Havana municipality and included in ies district for population counts. In\nthis sense the hinterland extended east and southeast to border Jibacoa, Gilines, and\nMayabeque and west and southwest to Guaxaibon and Guanimar. See G. Douglas In-\nglis, “Land and Labor in the Havana Hinterland, 1750-90” (paper presented at Tulane\nUniversity Symposium on Comparative Colonial History, 1983), 1-2. This practical defini-\ntion permits a measure of control for analytical purposes. It should be understood never-\ntheless that although the interior sections of the island enjoyed a strong measure of\nautonomy from Havana, as reflected by a certain independence in commercial’ ar-\nrangements, they might be considered a hinterland in a larger sense. Indeed, as shall\nbe seen later in this essay, much of the Spanish American empire functioned commer;\ncially and militarily as Havana’s hinterland. 9\n\n2. “Padrén general de la Isla de Cuba,” December 31, 1778, Archivo General de In-\ndias, Santo Domingo (hereafter cited as AGI, SD), legajo 1525.

Kuethe\n\nover hundreds of militiamen were mobilized, some to join the expeditionary\nforce but most to replace veterans who had left to fight elsewhere. Once\nmobilized the militia had to be paid, fed, and housed, adding yet another\nburden to the royal treasury and creating one more source of revenue for\nHavana. The Havana garrison returned to its normal peacetime size soon\nafter Spanish victory was confirmed in the Treaty of Paris of 1783, but dur-\ning the previous four years military expenditures in the city had reached\nitceanans proportions.°°\n\nTaken together the fortification costs, ttoop maintenance, ship building,\nand military operations served to draw impressive sums of Mexican silver\ninto Havana. The Mexican situado provides a rough gauge to calculate\nthe extent of royal expenditure in the Cuban capital. The subsidy, it will\nbe recalled, averaged about 437,000 pesos annually during the late 1750s,\nwhen it also bad to cover shipbuilding costs. This figure surged to an an-\nnual average of 1,485,000 during the period 1763-69, leveled off at 1,280,000\nduring the years 1771-79, jumped to 2,701,000 in 1780, 4,163,000 in 1781,\n7,898,000 in 1782, and 8,469,000 in 1783, but then returned to peacetime\nlevels. 5!\n\nWhen Spain emerged from the War of the American Revolution, more-\nover, it was not yet a satisfied power. Victory in Florida had merely whetted\nits appetite and, during the 1780s, the crown continued to plot offensive\naction against the British, dreaming of the recapture of Jamaica and Belize\nin America and Gibraltar in Europe.5? The royal treasury thus continued\nto advance the fortification works in Havana, to sustain the enlarged Ha-\nvana garrison and the disciplined militia, and to pursue vigorously the con-\nstruction of warships. The military-industrial complex thus drew many\nmore millions of pesos into the Havana economy during the remainder\nof the decade and on into the 17908.53\n\nThe precise effect of this enormous inflow of treasure on the Havana\neconomy has not yet been measured, but the general outline is clear enough.\n\n#/The demand for goods and services and for laborers and craftsmen ob-\nviously mushroomed. Fortunes were surely made by defense contractors\nand those who had access to His Majesty’s monies. How much was ac-\ntually spent as intended probably cannot be determined, for successful\nembezzlers leave few tracks. The fortifications were indeed built bist it is\ncurious that the situado never seemed to be enough, decade after decade,\nas the Mexican taxpayers complained that their silver disappeared into\nHavana's financial maze. At the very least, this inflow of treasure established\na level of financial liquidity that was unique in the empire. It is instructive\nthat, when Francisco Saavédia—special agent for the’Grown — attempted\n\nto raise a loan of a half million pesos in Havana to finance the French\nforces moving toward Yorktown, he was able to do so in six hours.54 Both\n\n \n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century\n\n25\n\nFranklin Knight and Manuel Moreno Fraginals have hypothesized that the V\nMexican situado went far to finance the remarkable expansion of the sugar\nindustry during the period following the Seven Years’ War.55 That point\nseems beyond dispute. It is equally evident that the process of capital ac-\ncumulation enhanced Havana’s potential as a commercial, entrepreneurial\ncenter.\n\nThus far the casual emphasis in the present analysis has focused primar-\nily on geographic considerations and their attendant commercial and mili-\ntary implications. However, any real understanding of the development of\nurban Havana must also take into account /abanero entrepreneurial and\npolitical skills. Havana’s patricians understood perfectly the advantages\nthat the strongpoint’s position in the imperial defense system afforded them,\nand they exploited those advantages ably. As explained earlier, habaneros ue\nhad exhibited strong entrepreneurial instincts in 1740 when merchant-\nplanters had prevailed upon the crown to establish the Royal Havana Com-\npany with half of the shares under their control, At that time they con-\nfronted and overcame strong opposition to their plan from the Consulado\nof Cadiz.5* The events following the Seven Years’ War took the process\nfurther.\n\nThe decision to arm Havana through the establishment of a disciplined\nmilitia bore important political implications. To train Cubans in the use of\narms represented a fundamental shift of power to colonial hands. Moreover\nthe crown expected the municipality to uniform and equip the several regi-\nments and battalions and to accommodate the award of military privileges\nto thousands of inhabitants, including sixteen hundred blacks and mulat-\ntoes. Given the prevailing cultural ethos, white volunteer offices were as-\nsigned to habanero patricians who sought military honors and privileges\nto validate their social and political pretenses.5? Royal cooperation with f /\nthe interlocking directory that dominated Havana’s political and economic {\nstructure thus assumed critical importance.\n\nOn another level, a decision to reorganize the colonial tax structure and\ncommercial system accompanied the military reorganization, although the\nprecise shape that these measures would take was unclear when Charles\nIII dispatched the Conde de Ricla to accept possession of Havana from\nthe British and begin the reform process. In the wake of Spain’s military\ndefeat, a reformist government had emerged in Madrid under the Mar-\nqués de Esquilache, who was minister of war and finance. Esquilache was\ndetermined to increase colonial revenues both through more rigorous re-\nvenue programs and through a thorough restructuring of the imperial com-\nmercial system. Freer trade, he hoped, would foment economic growth 1 v\nand enable Spain to attract a larger percentage of the American commerce\nto the peninsula, thereby undercutting contraband.

Kuethe\n\nde Galvez was winning glory for Spain on the North American continent,\nCubans gained the right to neutral trade with the United States. They ex-\ntracted the equally important right to trade with the French islands for\nslaves, a concession not fully withdrawn until 1786.65 Havana had lobbied\nfor a free slave trade during the negotiations of 1763-65,, but the crown,\nhaving contracted with foreign dealers, did not accede to the petition, and\na shortage of slave labor probably constrained sugar expansion up to the\nWar of the American Revolution. Once access to French sources was with-\ndrawn, habanero lobbyists renewed their quest for a liberalized trade, and\nsuccessfully so. In 1789 the government of Charles IV (1788-1808) intro-\nduced the principle of free trade in the Havana slave market for all Spanish\n‘subjects and, for the period of two years, permitted habaneros to procure\nslaves from any available source, a privilege that included the right to mar-\nket goods in slave ships.6¢ ; ;\nThe effects of the collapse: of the slave society of Saint Domingue in\n1791, coupled with Spain’s involvement in the wars of the French Revolu-\ntion and of Napoleon soon after, opened a new phase in the history of\nHavana. With the destruction of the plantations of Saint Domingue the\n\nopportunities for Cuban sugar seemed almost unlimited, and new plant-\n\nings advanced at a frenzied pace. In the midst of international upheaval,\nmoreover, Havana’s dependence on the metropolis weakened at an ac-\ncelerated pace as Spain’s financial, military, and—ultimately— political\ninfluence waned. By the turn of the century, babaneros would find them-\nselves largely in contro! of their own destiny.\n\nNeither the authorities in Madrid nor the Havana patriciate was slow\nto grasp the economic implications of the slave victory in Cuba's sister\nisland. Havana lobbied for and received another series of tariff conces-\nsions benefiting the sugar industry, the right to establish its own merchant\nguild (comsulado), and permission to found the Patriotic Society of the\nFriends of the Nation, an organization designed to promote applied science\nand progressive, practical knowledge. Havana procured-a renewal of its\nprivileges in the slave trade for another six years, and thereafter indefinitely,\nand in 1793, with the opening of the French War, gained access to neutral\ntrade.®7 ;\n\nMadrid of course viewed neutral trade as a temporary expedient, but\n\nSutiernsviatial developments quickly weakened its leverage. First thrashed\nby French revolutionary armies in Europe, then forced into an unfortunate\nuneasy alliance with France, Spain saw its military and financial position\ndeteriorate badly. The two British wars, 1796-1802 and 1804-8, severely\nimperiled imperial commerce, and the Battle of Trafalgar, of October 1805,\ncost His Majesty much of the fleet. By 1808 the royal treasury had reached\nastate of de facto bankruptcy.®* As Havana entered the nineteenth century\n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 29\n\nthe veteran. garrison quickly withered, military expenditures waned and,\nthrough the disciplined militia, Cubans gradually assumed responsibility\nfor their own defense and with it their political destiny.6\n\nThroughout the continuing crisis the planter-officers, who held the mili-\ntia system together and whose units were manning the home front, found\nthemselves in a most advantageous position in their dealings both at court\nand in Havana. That the first three priors of the Consulado were militia\ncolonels was eloquent of the connection between 1 military service and com- ~~\nmercial aspiration. Under these circumstances Havana repeatedly managed\nto secure the right to neutral trade, a liberty that increasingly tied the city\nto the lucrative market in the United States, providing access to the young\nnation’s vast merchant marine. Spain attempted from time to time to limit\nthe extent of this trade but could do little. Royal orders proscribing Ha-\nvana’s access to the North American market were routinely ignored by the\nauthorities in Havana and, except for brief interruptions, Havana enjoyed\nunrestricted neutral trade from 1793 on.7°\n\nA fundamental transformation thus took place. Defense became largely\na local affair, with the level of royal subsidies falling as Spain’s financial\ndebacle worsened. But the phenomenal gfowth of the sugar industry picked\nup the slack, and Havana’s development continued apace. Stimulated by\nrising demand, Cuban output doubled during the 1790s and continued\nits advance into the nineteenth century despite a downward turn in prices\nafter 1800. Not all of this growth occurred in the Havana hinterland, of\ncourse, for the sugar revolution had now advanced to the outer zones of\nthe island. But the effect was most profound in the Havana district which\naccounted for some 92 percent of total Cuban exports for the years 1791-\n1800.7! Not surprisingly, legal Cuban tobacco exports, which stood at\n278,000 arrobas in 1790, declined as the international turmoil impeded\naccess to the European market, falling to 147,000 arrobas in 1796, and\nto 37,000 in 1803.72\n\nNorth American merchants had of course engaged in illegal trade with\nCuba for years. The British occupation of 1762-63 had afforded the op-\nPortunity to strengthen these commercial ties and, during the postwar\nperiod, the local authorities from time to time opened the port on an emer-\ngency basis to acquire essential supplies.73 During the War of the American\nRevolution, United States merchants took advantage of neutral trade to\nestablish trading houses in Havana. Although eventually expelled in the\naftermath as part of Spain’s mercantilistic policy, strong ties remained and\nwere quickly renewed and expanded during the wars of the French Revolu-\ntion and Napoleon.”* Thereafter foreign carriers became a prominent, fre- //\nquently dominant component of the Havana trade.75\n\nWhile Havana imported a wide variety of materials from the north, the\n\n \n\u000c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18 Allan J.

Such permission\nwas limited to trees destined for the shipyards and to the intervention of\nextraordinary considerations!® This restriction posed an impediment to\nthe potential growth of sugar plantings since trees stood in the path of\nexpansion, trees that planters also coveted for fuel and packing crates. It\n/|is instructive that as early as the 1770s Havana would become an importer\nof wood from Louisiana.?°\n/ Finally, another basic industry was local and regional defense. Havana\nserved as Spain’s primary American military base both for naval and land\nforces, Strategically situated on the outer rim of the empire —the empire’s\nantemural as it was called —Havana guarded the approach to Mexico. Its\nharbor sheltered the tieasure ships that rendezvoused in its waters. The\nbay bottlenecked at its mouth, easing the task of fortification. The massive\nMorro Castle stood at the eastern side of the entrance and was accom-\npanied by a lesser installation, La Punta, to the west. A stone wall sur-\nrounded the city itself, which was on the western side of the bay. By the\nmid-1750s the crown had assigned to Havana a veteran garrison of 1,642\nmen.2! Havana also acted as the principal naval base for the Armada de\nBarlovento until its disbandment in 1749. The Armada de Barlovento was\na small fleet usually consisting of two or three ships of the line and a num-\nber of lesser craft. It served to protect the trade routes, secure the Mexican\nsubsidy for Havana, harass pirates and—during wartime—Jamaican ship-\nping. The city also acted as a base to reinforce and defend Florida and,\nto a lesser degree, Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo.”\n\nIts defense functions provided Havana with yet another source of out-\nside income. Cuba itself was only lightly taxed, paying for example no\nalcabala until 1758 and then at only 2. percent rather than the much heavier\nlevies in most other colonies. During the 1750s the Havana treasury re-\ncorded an average annual income of merely 162,000 pesos from local\ntaxes.23 Spain met Havana’s military costs by assigning it a portion of its\nMexican income. This subsidy (situado) averaged about 267,000 pesos for\n\ni]t period 1750-55, serving as a source of outside specie that lubricated\nand undoubtedly stimulated the city’s economy.”*\n\nOwing to incomplete statistical data, the precise weight of the’several\ncontributors to Havana’s outside income on the eve of the Seven Years’ War\ncannot be determined, but the general dimensions are clear enough. The\nsituado largely represented military expenditures, less the amount for the\nnaval construction borne by the Royal Havana Company. Levi Marrero\nhas calculated the importance of ship building at an annual average of\nsome 125,000 pesos for the period from 1736 to 1757, the year the Royal\nHavana Company produced its last ship.?5 The Ministry of the Navy,\nhowever, had begun building craft at royal expense as early as 1754 al-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 19\n\nthough at first only on a small scale.2¢ A sharp increase in the situado of\n1756 reflected this transition, a jump proportionately equal to traditional\nship-building-costs. Unfortunately only the records for 1756 to 1757 and\n1759 have survived; they disclose an average of 437,000 pesos.27\n\nFor the civilian sector John McNeill has established the annual average\nexports for the Royal Havana Company during the period 1754-60 at ap-\nproximately 92,300 arrobas of tobacco, 237,000 arrobas of sugar, and\n11,650 hides, whose value can be calculated at roughly 370,000, 475,000\nand 35,000 pesos respectively. The Royal Company purchased nearly all\nof its tobacco in the Havana district, but some of the sugar and probably\nthe hides came from other regions of the island.28 Manuel Moreno Fragi-\nnals has traced the origin of the sugar that lay on the docks in April 1759\nawaiting export; 71 percent had been produced in, Havana’s hinterland.29\nOn the assumption that this percentage was representative, Havana’s por-\ntion of the annual average sale during the period 175460 would be about\n340,000 pesos. Because the hide industry enjoyed particularly high pro-\nficiency in the art of smuggling, its export contribution would be substan-\ntially higher than the amounts registered through the Royal Company’s pur-\nchases. Moreover no figure is available for the amount of beef sold to the\npassing maritime traffic, a commerce that added to the contribution of cat-\ntle ranching. All in all, then, sugar and tobacco contributed in roughly’ J\nequal proportions with cattle trailing but nevertheless playing an impor-\ntant role. Unfortunately no statistics are available either for the sale o\nother foodstuffs to maritime consumers calling in Havana or for the multi-\nple services the city provided them.\n\nHavana’s society reflected this diversified economy. By the time of the ww\nSeven Years’ War a well-defined creole patriciate of some fifty families had\nemerged. This elite held mixed investment portfolios emphasizing sugar\nand cattle with only faint remaining traces of tobacco holdings. Most held\nor had held government office of one sort or another, particularly in the\nmunicipality.3° Five men held titles of Castile while others enjoyed knight-\nhood in Spanish crusading orders or had entailed estates to confirm their\nsocial pretenses.3! A prominent connection to mercantile activity was also\nvisible, Habaneros, led by the city government, had pioneered the establish-\nment of the Royal Havana Company with broad elite participation includ-\ning four titled nobles, three of whom owed much of their original fortunes\nto tobacco.3? By the Seven Years’ War a connection to tobacco.lingered\nbut as indicated, sugar had displaced it“as the primary concern.33 ‘\n\nHabanero creole society extended all the way from the elite down to\nday laborers. A large middle sector included a host of retail merchants\nand small shopkeepers, quasiprofessionals (physicians, lawyers, teachers.\nclergymen, etc.), lesser functionaries of the royal administration, artisans,\n\u000cv\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nif\ni\n\n  \n\n14 Allan J.

To a considerable degree these cities represented\n“g rational adaption to the availability of capital and other resources and\nthe marketing problems of specific commodities.”3 In conjunction with their\ncomplex range of economic activities, large service industries and a notewor-\nthy level of industrial productivity appeared, accounting for their com-\nparatively large populations.\n\nSimilar factors appeared in the emergence of Havana. Unfortunately,\nprecise comparisons to its northern neighbors are impossible due to the\ncomplexity of its socio-economic formation and a lack of detailed infor-\nmation about its occupational structures. While it is abundantly clear, for\nexample, that a powerful nucleus of local entrepreneurs emerged at an early\ndate and ultimately excercised broad power over marketing decisions, a\nsystematic study of this sector and its business practices has not yet been\nattempted. Nor do the censuses for this period provide the sort of data\nthat might elucidate occupational divisions. Havana also differed from the\nEnglish American port cities in important ways. Its military functions ac-\ncounted for a level of official governmental activity that did not occur in\nthe thirteen colonies. An additional complication is imposed by the impor-\ntance of slavery—not only to the hinterland’s agricultural complex but in\n\n=\nthe urban ‘workplace ~— coupled with the presence of a large free black and\nmulatto population subject to special legal restrictions. Nevertheless Havana\nwas much more than a military strongpoint surrounded by slave-powered\nplantation agriculture. It was also an entrepdt for a commerce extending\nfar beyond its immediate hinterland and became an entrepreneurial locus\nwith striking general similarities to the successful North Atlantic port cities.\n\nHavana’s location afforded it a highly advantageous position in the im-\nperial commercial system. In an age when winds and currents determined\nsailing routes, the Cuban capital commanded the exit from the Caribbean\nSea as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Mexico and hence the route\nto and from Veracruz, the principal port city of Spain’s most important\ncolony. Havana also possessed a magnificent deepwater bay with the capa-\ncity to shelter large numbers of ships, and historically it had served as a\nway station for much of the legal commerce returning from the Indies.\nEarly in the century both the southern fleet, the galeones which carried\nthe commerce of South America via Portobelo and Cartagena, and the nor-\nthern fleet, the flota which served New Spain, anchored at Havana before\nbeginning their voyages back to Cadiz. The reorganization of commercial\npolicy under Philip V (1700-46), highlighted by the suspension of the\nsouthern fleet after 1739 and its replacement by registered ships, detracted\nsomewhat from the importance of the Caribbean trade. A growing percen-\ntage of the shipping from Peru, Chile, and Buenos Aires proceeded directly\nto Europe rather than through the more tedious and expensive Panama-\n\n \n\nHavana in the Eighteenth Century 15\n\nnian route. But at the same time the commerce of Mexico experienced\nphenomenal growth, more than compensating for losses in the south.\n\nAs the stopover for much of the maritime traffic returning from the In-\ndies, Havana played an enviable role. Ships had to be repaired and ca-\nreened; they took on stores; and officers, seamen, and passengers came\nashore. The flota might wait for months before the southern fleet joined\nit to begin the return voyage to Spain.* Moreover the number of transients\nassumed formidable proportions when His Majesty recalled Spanish bat-\ntalions serving in New Spain or New Granada (present-day Mexico and\nColombia). Local producers thus had’ an extraordinary market for fresh\nvegetables, fruits, and other commodities. Havana was surrounded by what\nin modern nomenclature would be called truck farms whose produce was\npartly directed to the needs of the maritime traffic and partly of course\nto the permanent population.‘\n\nTransatlantic shipping also provided at least some opportunity to market\nproducts for export since ship captains topped off their cargoes on their\nway back to Europe. Such opportunities were not, however, as promising\nas might be supposed. Spain’s mercantilistic policies subordinated th\neconomic needs of its colonies to Spanish commercial and political inter-\nests. By law all commerce between Europe and America was required to\npass through Cadiz and its merchant guild, the Consulado. The massive\nships used to move goods in convoys to Mexico and individual registered\nships destined to the Caribbean would normally return with full consign-\nments and did not ordinarily take on major quantities of produce at Ha-\nvana. Early in the century individual ships could of course be specifically\nregistered for Havana, and the South Sea Company, which operated the\nslave asiento (monopoly) from 1713 to 1739 under the provisions of the\nTreaty of Utrecht, enjoyed the right to extract goods in return for the sales\nit made in Havana. In 1734 the crown assigned the other Cuban trade to\na Spanish asentista and in 1738 transferred the business to another.é Haban-\neros also conducted a limited trade with the other colonies, principally\nNew Spain and New Granada, normally exchanging tobacco for foodstuffs\nor textiles, but the total value of this activity was small.” Untike the Euro-\npean trade, however, this American trade might be conducted in Cuban-\nowned vessels. Finally, a legal commerce existed with the Canary Islands.®\n\nAn important innovation occurred in 1740 when habaneros persuaded\nthe crown to establish the Royal Havana Company to serve as a’marketing\nvehicle for Cuban commodities. This company, like the preceding asen-\ntistas, would enjoy a limited monopoly over the Cuban trade in return for\nspecified services to the royal administration. One such company had al-\nteady been established in the Caribbean, the Royal Company of Guipuz-\ncoa in Caracas, but the Havana Company differed in that enterprising col-\n\n \n\n \n\u000c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPeggy K.

Kuethe\n\nHavana in the eighteenth century was an impressive city. The 1778 census\ncounted its inhabitants at 40,737 souls and those of its dependent hinter-\nland—which extended to the south coast and about thirty miles to the east\nand west—at some 41,000 more! Although smaller than the viceregal\ncapitals, Mexico City and Lima, it ranked as the third largest city of the\nSpanish American colonies and as the largest port. About the same size\nas Philadelphia, it compared favorably to the seaports of the newly inde-\npendent United States. Havana’s dimensions were particularly impressive\nin light of its island surroundings. Cuba, according to that same census,\npossessed only 179,484 inhabitants, meaning that the city of Havana con-\ntained nearly-23 percent of the total population and, with its hinterland,\nsome 46 percent.”\n\nLarge administrative capitals were of course commonplace in old regime\nstates, particularly in those such as Bourbon Spain where a high degree\nof centralization: had occurred. Havana was the seat of Cuba’s captain:\ngeneral and his administrative staff, the marine intendant, and after 1765\nthe intendente de guerra, although not the seat of a bishop until 1789 when\nHavana was separated from the diocese of Santiago, the historic see of\nCuba, In typical fashion, landed patricians congregated in the colonial\ncapital, establishing lavish households that added weight to the city’s size\nand luster. As its large population suggests, nevertheless, Havana was\nanything but a typical preindustrial capital city. It assumed its peculiar\neighteenth-century pérsonality owing to the interplay of complex forces’\nboth within and outside the Spanish empire, but the fundamental explana-\ntion can be found in its unique maritime functions, its lucrative relation-\nship to the colonial defense system and, in the long run, Cuba’s own inter-\nnal economic development. en\n\nSuccessful eighteenth-century port cities such as Philadelphia and New:\nYork possessed advantageous geographical positions and strong export\ntrades growing out of productive hinterlands but, as explained by Jacob\nPrice, they also developed prominent groups of resident entrepreneurs who\nwere able to localize commercial decision making, and they came to func-\ntion as entrepdts for a commerce extending well beyond the limits of their\n\n13\n\u000c"
